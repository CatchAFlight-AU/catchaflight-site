      <p>
        When planning a trip from Australia to the USA with United Airlines, understanding the airline’s baggage policy is essential for a smooth and stress-free travel experience. Whether you’re flying in Economy, Premium Economy, or Business Class, it’s important to know what you’re allowed to bring, what the fees are, and how to avoid unexpected charges at the airport.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In this article, we’ll cover the key points of United Airlines’ baggage policy, including allowances for carry-on and checked baggage, additional fees, and tips for managing your luggage.

      <h2>Carry-On Baggage Allowance</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Passengers flying with United Airlines from Australia are entitled to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item into the cabin. Here’s what you need to know about the carry-on rules:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Carry-On Bag Size:</strong> The maximum dimensions for your carry-on bag are 22 x 14 x 9 inches (56 x 35 x 22 cm), including wheels and handles.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Item:</strong> This includes items like a purse, laptop bag, or small backpack. The personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and should not exceed 9 x 10 x 17 inches (22 x 25 x 43 cm).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        It’s important to ensure your carry-on luggage meets these size requirements, as oversized bags may need to be checked at the gate, potentially incurring additional fees.
      </p>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section>
      <h2>Checked Baggage Allowance</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The number of checked bags allowed, and their size and weight limits depend on your cabin class and ticket type. Here’s a breakdown of United Airlines’ checked baggage policy:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Economy Class</strong></p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Checked Bag:</strong> Free for international flights departing from Australia.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Checked Bag:</strong> Fees apply for a second checked bag, typically around $100 AUD, depending on the route.</li>
        <li><strong>Bag Size and Weight:</strong> Each checked bag must not exceed 50 pounds (23 kg) in weight and 62 linear inches (158 cm) in combined length, width, and height.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Premium Economy and Business Class</strong></p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First and Second Checked Bags:</strong> Free for Premium Economy and Business Class passengers.</li>
        <li><strong>Bag Size and Weight:</strong> Each bag can weigh up to 70 pounds (32 kg), which is more generous than the allowance for Economy passengers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section>
      <h2>Excess Baggage Fees</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        If your baggage exceeds the weight or size limits, or if you bring more than the allowed number of checked bags, you’ll be charged additional fees. Here’s what you need to know:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overweight Bags:</strong> Bags weighing between 50 and 70 pounds (23 to 32 kg) are subject to overweight fees. The exact amount varies but can range from $200 to $300 AUD per bag, depending on the route.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversized Bags:</strong> If your bag exceeds the size limit of 62 linear inches, you may also be charged for oversized baggage, typically $300 AUD per bag.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        To avoid these extra fees, make sure your bags meet the standard size and weight requirements. Consider packing light or upgrading to Business Class for a more generous baggage allowance.

      <h2>Special Baggage Items</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        United Airlines allows passengers to bring special items such as sports equipment, musical instruments, and medical devices. However, these items must meet specific guidelines:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sports Equipment:</strong> Items like surfboards, golf clubs, and bicycles can be checked as part of your baggage allowance, but additional fees may apply for oversized or overweight items.</li>
        <li><strong>Musical Instruments:</strong> Instruments that fit within the carry-on dimensions can be brought on board as a carry-on item. Larger instruments must be checked, and fees may apply if they exceed the baggage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Devices:</strong> Medical equipment, such as wheelchairs or CPAP machines, can be brought on board free of charge, provided the airline is notified in advance.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>
        To make your journey as smooth as possible, here are some key tips for managing your luggage when flying with United Airlines from Australia:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-Pay for Checked Bags:</strong> If you know you’ll need extra luggage, pre-pay for your checked bags when booking your ticket online. This will help you avoid higher fees at the airport.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Baggage Trackers:</strong> Invest in a luggage tracker so you can easily locate your bags in case they are delayed or lost.</li>
        <li><strong>Pack Smart:</strong> Ensure your carry-on and personal item fit the size guidelines to avoid having them checked at the gate. Pack valuable items, electronics, and medications in your carry-on for easy access.</li>
        <li><strong>Know Your Allowances:</strong> Check your ticket for specific baggage allowances, as they may vary depending on the fare type and cabin class.</li>
      </ul>
